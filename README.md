# MOTION-CORE
This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify human activities based on sensor data collected from a smartphone. The dataset consists of sensor readings such as accelerometer and gyroscope signals, capturing six different activities: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying. The aim is to build accurate models using various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict these activities. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation to achieve optimal performance.
